I made this "project" so I could study for my Javascript remedial exam.
I created a main stack with size 3 and three auxiliary stacks, each with size 10. I inserted the three auxiliary stacks into the main stack.
I added 3 names to the first auxiliary stack, 5 names to the second, and 10 names to the third.
Finally, I removed all the names from the auxiliary stacks in order of priority.
